Files used by scripts in the Methylation directory

- Averaged methylation files not included in this directory, since they are very large (look in preprocessing directory for more information)

- The methylation reference file ("methylation_annotation_ref.csv.tar.bz2"), which contains information regarding the genomic location, proximal genes, and feature type for each probe (identical sample-to-sample), was downloaded from GDC for the male sample with highest XIST expression (TCGA-XE-AAOL-01): https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/files/d28c38a5-eec4-4576-9226-2b8d9b781f3e
