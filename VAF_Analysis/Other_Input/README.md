Files used by scripts in the VAF_Analysis directory

- Note: "mc3.v0.2.8.PUBLIC.maf", the TCGA germline variant-filtered MAF is very large and can be downloaded from GDC: http://api.gdc.cancer.gov/data/1c8cfe5f-e52d-41ba-94da-f15ea1337efc
- Averaged RNA-seq files not included in this directory, since they are very large (look in preprocessing directory for more information)
